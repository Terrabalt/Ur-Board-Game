<h1>Ur Board Game</h1>

This is a (very rudimentary and definitely unfinished) board game of Ur, made in MonoGame. All graphics are made using primitives from the <a href="https://github.com/z2oh/C3.MonoGame.Primitives2D">this port of C3.MonoGame.Primitives2D</a>.

The rules are interpreted from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZskjLq040I">this video, courtesy of The British Musium</a>.
